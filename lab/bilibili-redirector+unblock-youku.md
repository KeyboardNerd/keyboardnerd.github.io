use Unblock Youku with redirector with the following configuration:
https://github.com/KeyboardNerd/keyboardnerd.github.io/blob/master/lab/bilibili-redirector-regex.json

the CDN is optimized based on the request sender, which is the Unblock Youku server. 
So, for foreigh IP, it should be redirected.
Now this may not work sometimes, and my guess is some weird shit of the front-end.
